# Introduction

## Aims
The aim for this topic is to teach you how to use and interpret the `glm()` function in R for response data which are Poisson distributed (counts). 

## Objectives 
By doing the independent study before each Blackboard workshop and working with others to solve workshop problems the successful student will be able to:

* Explain the link between the general linear models and the generalised linear model
* Recognise a Poisson distributed response variable
* Appropriately apply generalised linear models to Poisson distributed data using `glm()`
* Interpret and report the results 


## Independent Study

The minimum independent study required was to read the Preface and chapters 1, 2 and 3 of [singlm:](https://3mmarand.github.io/singlm/) ***S**imple **In**troduction to **GLM** for analysing Poisson and Binomial responses in R*.
An optional extension was to read chapter 4 in preparation for the optional extension data scenario.

# Instructions

Designate roles: 

1. the code host  
2. the report host  
3. chat monitor
4. the researchers

The code host opens RStudio and shares their screen. They type the code and comments that you collaboratively write. The report host creates a googledoc which they share with all the group members. You collaboratively write the googledoc. I suggest the start is used for ideas and comments before you add a report you collaboratively write. At the start of a problem the code host shares their screen showing RStudio and towards the end, the report host will share their screen.
The chat monitor makes sure everyone is aware of breaking news and ideas in the chat that they might miss if focussed on the googledoc or RStudio. The researchers keep the group on track making sure the items in the list below are addressed and looking up things in 17C / 08C and [gist-lm:](https://3mmarand.github.io/gist-lm/)

<font size = "4">
`r emo::ji("heart")` Be kind, be understanding, be flexible  
`r emo::ji("document")` Use collaborative notes - document your ideas and process.  
`r emo::ji("flower")` Contribute actively to the coding and reporting - your code and report hosts should not feel they have all the responsibility.  
`r emo::ji("heart")`Allow people to contribute to the process silently by writing in the googledoc or using the chat  
</font>

For each data scenario:

* use a new RStudio Project containing folders: `data-raw`, `scripts` and `figures`
* check you understand the structure of the data
* identify the response and explanatory variables
* make a quick plot of the data and summarise it
* build a model with `glm()` and examine it using `summary()`
* what are the model coefficients and how do these relate to the response?
* what is the null deviance of the response? And the residual deviance of model? 
* determine the reduction in deviance and whether it is significant 
* use `predict()` to make predictions for a set sensible values for the explanatory variable(s)   
* write a report on the results. This will be no more than a few sentences reporting the results and an accompanying figure which you also write to file. 
* post your report to the Padlet
* go through your code adding comments, removing code that no longer reflects steps in your analysis and reporting, and reordering where necessary  
* examine some of the other reports posted on the Padlet. What did you do well? What could you have done better? Add these as comments to your own Padlet post
* make sure the RStudio Project and the googledoc is shared with everyone in your group



# Data scenarios

## 1. The effect of age on locomotor ability of mutant flies
The effect of age on locomotor ability of *Drosophila* with a Parkinson's disease-associated mutation was determined by using a climbing assay. Ten flies of each tested age (in days) were placed in 3 replicate vials and the number able to climb to a set height within a set time was recorded. The data in are [park.txt](../data-raw/park.txt). Each row is a vial.   

```{r }
# Disease progression in Parkinson's disease-associated mutants

# library(tidyverse)
# read in the data file
park <- read_table2("../data-raw/park.txt")

# check you understand the structure of the data
str(park)
# there are two numeric variables

# identify the response and explanatory variables
# the response is the number of flies in a vial that can climb to the given height within a set time; age is the explanatory variable

# make a quick plot of the data and summarise it
ggplot(data = park, aes(x = age, y = flies)) +
  geom_point()
# it looks at the fewer older flies are able to make the climb

# build a model with `glm()` and examine it using `summary()`
mod <- glm(data = park, flies ~ age, family = poisson)

# what are the model coefficients?
mod
exp(mod$coefficients)
# b0 is 1.9306 and b1 is -0.0386 
# the predicts 6.89 age 0 flies will be able to make the climb and this changes by a factor of 0.96 for each da (i.e., decreases)
# the equation of the line is ln(flies)  = 1.9306 -0.0386 × age or
# flies = 6.8935499 * 0.9621374^age

# what is the null deviance of the response? And the residual deviance of model? 
summary(mod)
# the Null deviance is 23.484  and the Residual deviance is 16.177  

# determine the reduction in deviance and whether it is significant 
# the deviance has reduced by 7.307
anova(mod, test = "Chisq")
# this is a significant reduction p = 0.006868

# evaluate whether the assumptions of the model are met
plot(mod, which = 1)
plot(mod, which = 2)
# these look 'ok' although the sample size is modest

# use `predict()` to make predictions for a set sensible values for the explanatory variable(s)   
# her I do it for ages from 10 to 30 days in steps of 5 days (5 values)
# create a data frame of the x values from which you want to predict
predict_for <- data.frame(age = seq(10, 30, 5))
# add predictions to that data.frame
predict_for$pred <- predict(mod, newdata = predict_for, type = "response")

## 2. The effect of a MAP Kinase Inhibitor on the number of nuclei in neurons

The importance of Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in regulating cell division led researchers to hypothesise that MAPK inhibition might effect cytokinesis following mitosis. They treated samples of neurons with PD089059, a MAPK inhibitor, at various concentrations (1 to 15 in arbitrary units) and recorded the number of nuclei per cell.
The data in are [kinase.txt](../data-raw/kinase.txt). Each row is a cell.   

```{r }
# The effect of a MAPK Kinase Inhibitor on the number of nuclei in neurons
# library(tidyverse)
# read in the data file
mapk <- read_table2("../data-raw/kinase.txt")

# check you understand the structure of the data
str(mapk)
# there are two numeric variables

# identify the response and explanatory variables
# the response is the number of nuclei in a call; pdconc, the concentration of PD089059 is the explanatory variable

# make a quick plot of the data and summarise it
ggplot(data = mapk, aes(x = pdconc, y = nuclei)) +
  geom_point()
# the three cells with the highest number of nuclei were treated with highest concentrations but the pattern is not strong.

# build a model with `glm()` and examine it using `summary()`
mod <- glm(data = mapk, nuclei ~ pdconc, family = poisson)

# what are the model coefficients?
mod
exp(mod$coefficients)
# b0 is 0.007736 and b1 is 0.085826   
# this predicts 1.007766 nuclei at concentration of zero. This changes by a factor of 1.089617 for each unit of concentration (ie., increases)
# the equation of the line is ln(nuclei)  = 0.007736 + 0.085826   × conc or
# nuclei = 1.007766 * 1.089617^conc

# what is the null deviance of the response? And the residual deviance of model? 
summary(mod)
# the Null deviance is 63.03  and the Residual deviance is 55.24  

# determine the reduction in deviance and whether it is significant 
# the deviance has reduced by 7.7891
anova(mod, test = "Chisq")
# this is a significant reduction p = 0.005256 

# evaluate whether the assumptions of the model are met
plot(mod, which = 1)
plot(mod, which = 2)
# these look 'ok' 

# use `predict()` to make predictions for a set sensible values for the explanatory variable(s)   
# her I do it for concentrations from 0 to 10 days in steps of 2.5 units.
# In reality, you probably wouldn't need this at the concentrations are already in nice round units - 0 - 14 in steps of one. So you could just predict for the model with
# mapk$pred <- predict(mod, type = "response")
# I've done it for different values just to provide another example fo doing it
# create a data frame of the x values from which you want to predict
predict_for <- data.frame(pdconc = seq(0, 10, 2.5))
# add predictions to that data.frame
predict_for$pred <- predict(mod, newdata = predict_for, type = "response")

# write a report on the results. This will be no more than a few sentences reporting the results and an accompanying figure which you also write to file.

# Optional Extension

## 3. Effect of age and cancer status on the number of mutations

The number of mutations in the hypermutable tetranucleotide marker D7S1482 were analysed in buccal specimens from 30 head and neck carcinoma cases and 43 controls. Also recorded was the subject's age (in years). The goal of analysis was to determine whether age and cancer status could predict the number of mutations. The data are in  [mutation.txt](../data-raw/mutation.txt) and comprise the following variables:

* mut : the number of mutations
* age : a continuous measure of the subject's age to the nearest 0.1 of a degree.
* cat : a factor with two levels, "control" and "tumour"


```{r }
# The effect of age and cancer status on the number of mutations in a hypermutable tetranucleotide marker
# read in the data file
mutation <- read_table2("../data-raw/mutation.txt")

# check you understand the structure of the data
str(mutation)
# there are three variables and 73 observations. Two variables are numbers, 
# one is a factor with two levels

# identify the response and explanatory variables
# the response is 'mut'; the explanatory variables are 'age' and 'cat'

# build a model with `glm()`
mod <- glm(data = mutation, mut ~ cat * age, family = "poisson")

# examine the model result using `summary()` and `anova()`
summary(mod)
anova(mod, test = "Chisq")

# what are the model estimates?
# can be read from summary or accessed like this:
mod$coefficients

# the model estimates are logged (to base e), therefore need to be antilogged for interpretation. Antilog is exp()
exp(mod$coefficients) 
# (Intercept)     cattumour           age cattumour:age 
#    7.863668      1.335158      1.008159      1.015422  

# interpret the results 
# the intercept is the number of mutations when the cat factor is control (level 1) and age is zero, 7.89 mutations. This increases but not significantly, by a factor of 1.34 in the tumour group. For every unit increase in age in the control group, the number of mutations increases by a factor of 1.01 (NS) but there is a bigger effect of age on the number of mutations in the tumour group. Based on the effects of cat and age we would expect an increasee of 7.863668*1.008159*1.335158 = 10.5849 mutations per unit of age in the tumour group. But we get 7.863668*1.008159*1.335158*1.015422 = 10.74814

# one way to help you think about the results is to make the predictions
# this requires creating a data frame of the x values fromn which you want to predict
predict_for <- data.frame(cat = rep(c("control", "tumour"), each = 3), age = rep(c(0:2), times = 2))
# then predicting
predict_for$pred <- predict(mod, newdata = predict_for, type = "response")
# The Analysis of Deviance Table shows that the effects of age, cat and the interaction between them are significant.
# For glm() it is deviance rather than variance that tells us about model fit.

# use `plot(mod, which = 1)` and `plot(mod, which = 2)` to examine the assumptions
plot(mod, which = 1)
plot(mod, which = 2)
# These look ok.

# plot
ggplot(data = mutation, aes(x = age, y = mut, colour = cat)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "glm",
              method.args = list(family = "poisson"),
              se = FALSE) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("black", "gray75"), 
                       name = "Patient\nCategory",
                       labels = c("Control", "Tumour")) +
  xlab("Age (years)") +
  ylab("Number of mutations") +
  theme_classic()
