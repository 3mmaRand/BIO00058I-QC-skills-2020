# Introduction

## Aims
In the third of three related workshops we will learn to apply and interpret the glm() function to binary (binomial) response data.

## Objectives 
By actively following the first lecture, working through workbook examples during the workshop workshop and any completing follow-up independent study the successful student will be able to:

* Explain the link between the general linear models and the generalised linear model
* Recognise where a generalised linear model for binomially distributed data would be appropriate and apply `glm()`
* Determine which effects are significant using using `summary()` and `anova()`

You can optionally stretch yourself by asking for more in-depth explanations about the meaning of the estimates, and the direction and magnitude of the effects or creating figures to go with your analyses. Biomedical Scientists might be particularly interested in binomial glm estimates ('odds ratios').


# Workbook Instructions

The workbook for this session is divided in to 2 sections. 

**You are not expected do all of the workbook examples**

Choose **one** from each section that best matches your biological interests. For each example you choose, you should:

* write comments in your scripts!
* read in the data file
* check you understand the structure of the data
* identify the response and explanatory variables
* build a model with `glm()`
* examine the model result using `summary()` and `anova()`
* what are the model estimates?
* interpret the results - you might find it helpful to use `predict()`  
* use `plot(mod, which = 1)` and `plot(mod, which = 2)` to examine the assumptions

Optional Extension: Practice your plotting skills.

### Wolf Spiders

This example concerns the effect of sand grain size on the presence of wolf spiders.
Suzuki et al. (2006) measured sand grain size on 28 beaches in Japan and observed the presence or absence of the burrowing wolf spider _Lycosa ishikariana_ on each beach. The data are in [grainsize.txt](../data/grainsize.txt). Can you predict the presence of spiders from the sand grain size?

# whether a spider is present or not; gsize is the explanatory variable

# build a model with `glm()`
# binary outcome so it is binomial
mod <- glm(data = grainsize, spiders ~ gsize, family = binomial)



# examine the model result using `summary()` and `anova()`

# the 'slope' is the change in log odds of spiders being present over absent with each unit of grainsize
# that it is positive means odds of being present increase

### Oesophageal cancer

This examples examines the effect of alcohol consumption on the incidence of oesophageal cancer in men over 55 years of age.
Thirty men aged 55 years and over were survey for their alcohol consumption then followed up 10 years later for the occurrence of oesophageal cancer. The data are in [oesoph.txt](../data/oesoph.txt) and comprise two variables:

* status : a variable which indicates whether the individual had developed oesophageal cancer (1) or not  (0)
* alcohol :  the amount of alcohol consumed per week in grams

### Age-related macular degeneration

This example concerns the Progression of moderate age-related macular degeneration to advanced AMD.
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a deterioration the macula, a small area in the retina responsible for central vision. There is no cure and treatment is focused on slowing the progression of moderate AMD to advanced AMD and the resulting vision loss. There is variation in response a treatment called AREDS and in order to understand this, researchers determined a person's genotype,  their refined carbohydrate intake and whether they developed advanced AMD after 7 years of AREDS treatment. The data are in  [amd.txt](../data/amd.txt) and comprise the following variables:

* aamd: whether or not an individual developed advanced AMD after 7 years (0 or 1)
* HRC: a continuous measure of the amount of highly refined carbs (kg per day)
* genotype: a factor with two levels,ARMS2 and CFH

Each row is an individual

```{r echo=FALSE,results="hide",warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
# The Progression of moderate age-related macular degeneration to advanced AMD

# they developed advanced AMD

# read in the data file

# it has 53 observations and 3 variables, one is a factor, 
# one is a binomial (0 or 1) and the last is continuous

# identify the response and explanatory variables
# the response is 'aamd' a binary variable that indicates 
# whether a person is developed advance age-related
# macular degeneration.
# a person's allele and their highly refined carbohydrate
# intake are explanatory variables 

# build a model with `glm()`
# binary outcome so it is binomial

# examine the model result using `summary()` and `anova()`
# what are the model estimates?

# alleles is siginificant, HRC seems not to be 
# and that effect is the same for both alleles

levels(amd$alleles) # tells us what the intercept relates to (first level)
# the intercept is the log odds of getting aamd over
# not getting it for ARMS2 individuals when HRC is zero
# that it is negative means the odds are less than 1 which
# means the probability of having aamd is less than 
# the probability of not having it for ARMS2 people
# when HRC is zero.
# allelesCFH is the log odds of having ammd over 
# not having it for CFH people vs ARMS2 people
# when HRC is zero. It's positive so
# for zero HRC, having a CFH allele increases your 
# risk relative to ARMS2 people
# HRC is positive meaning increasing HRC increases risk
# for ARMS2 people (but not signifcantly)
# allelesCFH:HRC is positive meaning the increase in risk
# caused by HRC is greater in CFH people (but not significantly)

# interpret the results - you might find it helpful to use `predict()`

### Skin micro-organisms

Human skin is colonised by a diverse collection of micro-organisms which vary considerably between individuals.  The presence or absence of a particular micro-organism on the skin of a number of individuals was determined along with variables which might influence presence. The data are in [microrg.txt](../data/microrg.txt) and comprise following variables:

* melanin : a continuous measure of the concentration of melanin in the individual's skin determined by the SR method
* age     : the individual's age in years (to one tenth of a year) 
* presence: whether the micro-organism is absent (0) or present (1) on the individual's skin
* gender  : female or male

The goal of analysis was to determine if the presence of the micro-organism could be predicted from an individual's gender, melanin concentration or age.

# check you understand the structure of the data

# with two levels, melanin and age are coninuous and presence 
# is a binomial (0 or 1) 

# identify the response and explanatory variables
# the response is 'presence' a binary variable that indicates 
# whether a person has the microorganism.
# a person's gender, age and melanin are the explanatory
# variables

# build a model with `glm()`

# the deviance test, anova(mod, test = "Chisq") tells us that
# gender and melanin have an effect but age does not.
# neither is the effect of melanin different for the
# two genders (the interaction is NS)

# the intercept is the log odds of having the microorganism over
# not having it for females when Age is zero and melanin is zero.
# That it is positive means the odds are greater than 1 which
# means the probability of having the microorganism is greater than 
# the probability of not having it for females aged 0 with no melanin.
# gendermale is the log odds of having the mirooganism over 
# not having it for males vs females when age and melanin
# are zero. It's positive so being male increases the 
# probability relative to females (significantly).
# melanin is negative meaning increasing melanin decreases the
# probability of having the microorganism for females (significantly).
# age is positive meaning increasing age icreases the
# probability of having the microorganism for females (but not siginfcantly)
# gendermale:melanin is negative the effct of increasing melanin
# in males is more negative in males than it was in females.
