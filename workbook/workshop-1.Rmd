# Introduction

## Aims
There are two aims for this topic. First to explain how the *t*-test, ANOVA and regression are actually all the same test and introduce the terminology of statistical modelling and, secondly, to teach you how to use and interpret the `lm()` function in R. 

## Objectives 
By doing the independent study before each workshop and working with others to solve workshop problems the successful student will be able to:

* Explain the link between *t*-tests, ANOVA and regression
* Appropriately apply linear models using `lm()`
* Interpret the results and relate them to the outputs of `t.test()` and `aov()`

Note that you should also be able to report the results of the examples and workshop problems which was a Stage 1 learning objective for 17C and 8C.

## Independent Study

This should have been carried out before the workshop. The minimum independent study required was to read the Preface and chapters 2, 5 and 6 of [gist-lm:](https://3mmarand.github.io/gist-lm/) ***G**et **I**ntroductory **S**tatistical **T**ests as **L**inear **M**odels: A guide for R users*.
An optional extension was to read chapter 7 in preparation for the optional extension data scenario.

# Instructions

I recommend:
-  discussing the examples with others
-  having open the book: [gist-lm:](https://3mmarand.github.io/gist-lm/) ***G**et **I**ntroductory **S**tatistical **T**ests as **L**inear **M**odels: A guide for R users*
-  looking up tests from 08C and 17C


For each data scenario:

-  use a new RStudio Project containing folders: `data-raw`, `scripts` and `figures` and use a new script for Data scenario
-  check you understand the structure of the data
-  identify the response and explanatory variables
-  make a quick plot of the data and summarise it
-  build a model with `lm()` and examine it using `summary()`
-  what are the model coefficients and how do they relate to the group means
-  what proportion of the variance in the response is explained by the model? 
-  evaluate whether the assumptions of the linear model are met
-  determine whether the effects are significant  
-  write a mini-report on the results. This will be no more than a few sentences reporting the results and an accompanying figure which you also write to file. 
-  go through your code adding comments, removing code that no longer reflects steps in your analysis and reporting, and reordering where necessary

# Data scenarios

## 1. Nicotinic acid on adipocytes

Adiponectin is exclusively secreted from adipose tissue and modulates a number of metabolic processes. Its secretion can be affected by nicotinic acid. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with nicotinic acid or with a control treatment and adiponectin concentration (pg/ml) measured. The data are in [adipocytes.txt](../data-raw/adipocytes.txt). Each row represents an independent sample of adipocytes and the first column gives the concentration adiponectin and the second column indicates whether they were treated with nicotinic acid or not.

## 2. Comparing standardization Methods

Researchers measure concentration of long-chain hydrocarbons, in a single unknown sample by three methods of standardisation using gas chromatography. They wish to determine whether the three standardisations methods give the same concentrations. The data are given in [analyte.txt](../data-raw/analyte.txt) and the first column gives the analyte concentration determined in parts per million and the second column indicates the standardisations method 'standard', 'internal standard' or 'standard addition'.

```{r}
# The effect of standardization method on the concentration of long-chain hydrocarbons determined (ppm) from a single sample

# read in the data file
analyte <- read_table("../data-raw/analyte.txt")

# identify the response and explanatory variables
# the response is ppm a continuous variable. method is the explanatory variable with three levels: internal_standard, standard and standard_addition

# make a quick plot of the data and summarise it
# quick plot
ggplot(data = analyte, aes(x = method, y = ppm)) +
  geom_violin()
# two of the methods give similar readings but the standard_addition method is giving lower concentrations
# summarise
analyte_summary <- analyte %>% 
  group_by(method) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(ppm),
            std = sd(ppm),
            n = length(ppm),
            se = std/sqrt(n))

# build a model with `lm()` and examine it using `summary()`
mod <- lm(data = analyte, ppm ~ method)
summary(mod)
# what are the model coefficients and how do they relate to the group means
# The first group of method is internal_standard so  
# b0 = 170.425 ppm is the mean of the internal_standard.  
# b1 = 4.500 is labelled methodstandard and is the difference between the internal_standard and standard methods, i.e., 170.425 + 4.500= 174.925 ppm.
# b2 = -27.375 is labelled methodstandard_addition and is the difference between the internal_standard and standard_addition methods, i.e., 170.425 -27.375 = 143.05 ppm.

# what proportion of the variance in the response is explained by the model? 
# 0.8966

# evaluate whether the assumptions of the linear model are met
plot(mod, which = 2)
plot(mod, which = 1)
# to be honest, the total number of data points makes this difficult to assess robustly
# but from what we can see, there are no big issues.

# determine whether the effects are significant  
anova(mod)
# the effect of method is significant ( p < 0.001) When there is only one variable in the model, this is the same as the F test at the end of the summary.
# we know from the summary that the internal_standard and standard_addition methods differ (because b2 was significant) but we need a post-hoc test to check all the pairwise comparisons. I'm using `lsmeans()` from the **`lsmeans`** package and `pairs()` from the **`multcompView`** to do a Tukey test

# the standard_addition method gives significantly lower concentrations than the other two methods.

## 3. Choline deficiency on neuron size

Cognitive performance is influenced by the choline intake in utero. To better understand this phenomenon, pregnant mice were fed a control or choline-deficient diet and their offspring examined. The cross sectional area (CSA) of cholinergic neurons was determined in two brain regions, the MSN and the DB. The data are given in [neuronregion.txt](../data-raw/neuronregion.txt)

```{r}
# The effect of maternal choline deficiency on neuron cross sectional area in two brain regions in Mice
# read in the data file
neuron <- read_table("../data-raw/neuronregion.txt")

# identify the response and explanatory variables
# the response is CSA a continuous variable. There are two explanatory variables: Diet with two level (control and deficient) and BrainRegion with two levels (DB and MSN)

# make a quick plot of the data and summarise it
# quick plot
ggplot(data = neuron, aes(x = Diet, y = CSA, fill = BrainRegion)) +
  geom_violin()
# it looks like the deficient diet does affect the cross sectional area of neurons, but mainly in the DB region. There seems to be a difference between the brain regions in a normal diet but not in the deficiant diet.
# summarise

# build a model with `lm()` and examine it using `summary()`
mod <- lm(data = neuron, CSA ~ Diet * BrainRegion)
summary(mod)
# what are the model coefficients and how do they relate to the group means
# The first group of Diet is control and the first group of BrainRegion is DB so  
# b0 = 26.665 is the mean of the Control-DB 
# b1 = -5.440 is labelled DietDeficient and is the difference between the Control-DB and Deficient-DB, i.e., the mean of Deficient-DB is 26.665 - 5.440 = 21.225 is 
# b2 = -5.695 is labelled BrainRegionMSN and is the difference between the Control-DB and Control-MSN, i.e., the mean of Control-MSN is 26.665 - 5.695 = 20.97 
# b4 = 4.403 is labelled DietDeficient:BrainRegionMSN and is the effect of changing both diet and region that is additional to their independent effects, i.e., the mean of Deficient-MSN is 26.665 - 5.440 -5.695 + 4.403 =  19.933
