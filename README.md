# Overview

## Introduction

This strand of 58I is designed to allow you to consolidate and extend your quantitative and computational skills. We build on the experimental design and data analysis skills developed in Stage 1 by deepening your understanding of the concepts underlying regression, t-tests and ANOVA and introducing additional methods of data analysis.

For each topic there will be required independent study followed by a Blackboard workshop in which you work in groups to appropriately analyse, and report on, given data sets. The independent study will involve reading the from the course book and a few short videos. Each topic will have a padlet on which your group will post its workshop report as well as for asking, answering and upvoting questions.

## Assessment
The workshop reports are formative. You do not need to work on these outside of the workshop itself.

The summative assessment is through the statistical and quantitative problem solving used in the Experimental Design and Bioscience Techniques options you do.

## Topics covered in Computational and Quantitative skills

It would be impossible to cover everything to you might ever need!

Different people will use different methods and tools.

The topics covered have been chosen because they:

* are foundational,
* naturally follow stage 1,
* are widely applicable (in this module and beyond) and
* are transferable conceptually

We will cover:

1. Understanding of General Linear Models (*i.e*., regression, t-tests and ANOVA) - Emma Rand

T-tests, ANOVA and regression are used when we have a continuous response variable. We revisit these using a linear modelling framework. This means using a single function lm() rather than three different ones and enhancing our understanding of the concepts underlying the tests. Learning more about the model assumptions, estimated coefficients and fit in this familar context will make it easier to understand them in the new context.

2. Generalised Linear Models for Poisson  response variables - Emma Rand

The Generalised Linear Model is an extension of the General Linear model for situations where the response variable does not follow the normal distribution. Key differences between General Linear Models and Generalised Linear Models is that estimates are on a different scale and we use deviance rather than variance for fit.  Here we consider GLMs when your response variable is a count where the coefficients are logged.

3. Generalised Linear Models for  Binomial response variables  - Emma Rand

Here we consider GLMs when your response variable can take only one of two values such as 0 or 1 or dead and alive. These variables follow a binomial distribution. Their estimates are on a "logit" scale.

4. Non-linear Models (non-linear regression) - Jon Pitchford

We will not cover:

* Methods which are specific to the Experimental Design / Bioscience Technique taken. These are are covered in that option by the option leader.
